# WebWindowNetCore
A .NET 8 Webview Application for Windows and Linux similar to Electron. It uses a functional builder pattern to set up the application. It has an integrated Asp.NET (Kestrel) server which can be used to host the app and to communicate between the .NET application and the web app. The web site can be hosted as .NET resource, of course alternatively via HTTP(s):// or file://.

WebWindowNetCore > version 10.0.0 is completely redesigned and programmed in F#, so that it is "F# friendly". Of course C# is supported as well. Unlike the older versions, there is no other Nuget packet required other than this. 

> WebViewNetCore.Linux and WebViewNetCore.Windows are now obsolete!

## Features

WebWindowNetCore includes following features:
* Is built on .NET 8
* Functional approach with a builder pattern
* (almost) the same setup for Windows and Linux version
* Uses WebView2 on Windows and WebKitGtk-6.0 on Linux
* Can serve the web site via .NET resources (single file approach)
* Optional save and restore of window bounds
* Has an integrated event sink mechanismen, so you can retrieve javascript events from the .NET app
* Has an integrated .NET Kestrel Server (optional) to serve requests from .NET app to javascript
* You can expand the Gtk Window (on Linux) with a custom header bar
* You can alternatively disable the Windows titlebar and borders, and you can build a title bar in HTML with standard Windows logic for closing, maximizing, restoring resizing, snap to dock, ...

Functional approach with webview builder:

```cs
new WebView()
    .AppId("de.uriegel.test")
    .InitialBounds(1200, 800)
    .Title("Web Window Net Core üëç")
    .ResourceIcon("icon")
    .ResourceScheme()
    .SaveBounds()
    .DefaultContextMenuDisabled()
    .AddRequest<Input, Contact>("cmd1", GetContact)
    .AddRequest<Input2, Contact2>("cmd2", GetContact2)
#if DEBUG    
    .DevTools()
#endif
    .Url("res://webroot/index.html")
    .CanClose(() => true)
    .OnStarted(action => action.ExecuteJavascript ("console.log('app started now ')"))
    .Run();
```
